# Snip

This was a basic gem I created using the generator. Nothing special. It was part of a tutorial to generate a basic gRPC architecture. https://shiladitya-bits.github.io/Building-Microservices-from-scratch-using-gRPC-on-Ruby/

I have since modified this a few more steps to create an upstream service (which really should be part of the experience), and add finished that all off by dockerizing it (also part of this initial tut), but when you have an up stream server it complicates the networking on docker. So, I've solve those issues. 

This gem is just the gRPC proto buffer definitions which is shared by all RPC services and the client.
